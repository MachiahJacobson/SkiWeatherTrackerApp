This is my final Project, A Ski/weather App. This app gives you the option of three Ski/snowboard resorts to choose from, where you can look at the weather, and a map of each resort and color-coded difficulty on each run. Lastly, I have provided certain tricks for beginners, intermediates, and pros.
